# Identifying Super-Responders to BaroStim Therapy in HFrEF: Comprehensive Peri-Procedural Autonomic Profiling

## BACKGROUND
Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) represents a promising neuromodulatory intervention for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), addressing the pathological autonomic imbalance characterized by sympathetic hyperactivation and parasympathetic withdrawal. Clinical trials demonstrate that while ~72% of appropriately selected patients (NYHA II-III, LVEF ≤35%, on optimal medical therapy) respond favorably to BAT, approximately 28% emerge as "super-responders" with dramatic improvements across multiple endpoints. Identifying these super-responders pre-implantation remains challenging, yet critical for maximizing therapeutic benefit and resource allocation. Current evidence suggests that patients with significant yet potentially reversible autonomic dysfunction respond most robustly to BAT, but standardized, multi-modal autonomic assessment protocols for patient selection are lacking.

## CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS

We hypothesize that comprehensive peri-procedural autonomic profiling combining physiological testing and neurohormonal biomarkers will identify a distinct autonomic phenotype predictive of superior LVEF improvement and reverse cardiac remodeling following BaroStim implantation.

## SPECIFIC AIMS

**Aim 1: Determine the predictive value of comprehensive peri-procedural autonomic assessment for identifying super-responders to BaroStim therapy.** We will perform multi-modal autonomic assessment immediately pre-implantation including: (a) baroreflex sensitivity via Oxford technique (phenylephrine/nitroprusside challenge); (b) heart rate variability (time/frequency domain analysis); (c) direct sympathetic recording via either skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) or muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) microneurography; and (d) plasma biomarkers (norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y, galanin). Outcomes (LVEF improvement ≥10%, LV reverse remodeling) will be assessed at 6 and 12 months post-implantation.

**Aim 2: Develop and validate a multiparametric autonomic risk score to stratify HFrEF patients for expected BaroStim response.** Using machine learning approaches, we will derive a weighted composite score based on key autonomic parameters that best predict super-response. The score will be internally validated using bootstrap resampling techniques and prospectively evaluated in a validation cohort. We hypothesize that patients with marked sympathetic activation yet preserved baroreflex responsiveness will demonstrate the greatest therapeutic benefit.

**Aim 3: Delineate the longitudinal autonomic adaptation patterns in super-responders versus modest-responders following BaroStim therapy.** Sequential autonomic assessment (3, 6, and 12 months) will characterize the temporal trajectory and magnitude of autonomic rebalancing. We hypothesize that super-responders will demonstrate accelerated and more complete restoration of autonomic parameters toward normal, correlating with superior reverse remodeling and functional improvements.

## SIGNIFICANCE

This study addresses a critical knowledge gap in neuromodulatory therapy for HFrEF by establishing: (1) objective, standardized criteria for identifying ideal BaroStim candidates; (2) mechanistic insights into autonomic phenotypes that predict therapeutic success; and (3) biomarker-guided patient selection algorithms to optimize resource utilization and maximize clinical benefit. By precisely targeting patients most likely to demonstrate reverse remodeling and LVEF improvement, this approach could transform BaroStim from a primarily symptomatic therapy to a disease-modifying intervention for appropriately selected HFrEF patients, significantly advancing the field of cardiac neuromodulation.
