# Background

Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) is approved for HFrEF patients ineligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) who remain symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy. 
While clinical trials demonstrate symptomatic improvement in most patients, data regarding objective endpoints such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remain inconsistent. 
Current selection criteria for BAT (NYHA II-III, LVEF ≤35%, narrow QRS, NT-proBNP <1600 pg/mL) do not directly assess autonomic function – the primary therapeutic target of BAT [@Abraham2015; @Blanco2023].
Given the heterogeneity of autonomic dysfunction in HFrEF, pre-procedural autonomic profiling may identify patients most likely to demonstrate objective improvement following BAT. 
This study addresses the critical knowledge gap between autonomic phenotypes and functional cardiac recovery following neuromodulation.

# Aims

**Aim 1: Develop a comprehensive peri-procedural autonomic assessment protocol to predict objective improvement following BaroStim therapy.** 

We will perform multi-modal autonomic assessment immediately pre-implantation including:

- Parasympathetic function: Baroreflex sensitivity via Oxford technique (phenylephrine/nitroprusside challenge)
- Sympathetic function: SKNA (skin sympathetic nerve activity) and where feasible, MSNA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) or direct stellate ganglia recordings
- Sympathovagal cross-talk: Plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels
- Standard measures: Heart rate variability parameters, plasma norepinephrine

Objective outcomes (primary: LVEF improvement ≥5%; secondary: LV volume reduction) will be assessed via cardiac imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months post-implantation.

**Aim 2: Identify specific autonomic parameters and threshold values predictive of objectively-defined super-responders to BaroStim therapy.**

We will correlate baseline autonomic parameters with magnitude of LVEF improvement and ventricular remodeling to identify:

- Which autonomic assessment modalities most reliably predict objective improvement
- Threshold values within each modality that differentiate super-responders (defined as LVEF improvement ≥10% and/or LV end-systolic volume reduction ≥15%)
- Cost-effectiveness of each assessment method for clinical implementation
- Changes in NPY at final follow-up compared to baseline in relation to outcomes

# Significance

Our study will establish autonomic profiles for BAT in HFrEF, potentially allowing an increased uptake of a therapy that is personalized and individualized beyond that of guideline-based parameters.
By identifying specific autonomic profiles associated with objective improvement, we can be start to tailor therapeutic options for individual patients, and potentially extend the indication to a broader population that may also have an impaired autonomic phenotype.
This approach could significantly advance BAT from a primarily symptomatic therapy to a disease-modifying intervention in appropriately selected HFrEF patients, while providing critical insights into autonomic mechanisms of heart failure progression and reversal.
