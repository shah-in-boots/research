  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of carotid BAT in advanced HF. BACKGROUND: Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity contribute to heart failure (HF) symptoms and disease progression. Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) results in centrally mediated reduction of sympathetic outflow and increased parasympathetic activity. METHODS: Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III HF and ejection fractions~≤35\% on chronic stable guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) were enrolled at 45 centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. They were randomly assigned to receive ongoing GDMT alone (control group) or ongoing GDMT plus BAT (treatment group) for 6 months. The primary safety end point was system- and procedure-related major adverse neurological and cardiovascular events. The primary efficacy end points were changes in NYHA functional class, quality-of-life score, and 6-minute hall walk distance. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six patients were randomized, 70 to control and 76 to treatment. The major adverse neurological and cardiovascular event-free rate was 97.2\% (lower 95\% confidence bound 91.4\%). Patients assigned to BAT, compared with control group patients, experienced improvements in the distance walked in 6 min (59.6 ± 14 m vs. 1.5~± 13.2 m; p~= 0.004), quality-of-life score (-17.4 ± 2.8 points vs. 2.1 ± 3.1 points; p~{$<$} 0.001), and NYHA functional class ranking (p~=~0.002 for change in distribution). BAT significantly reduced N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (p~= 0.02) and was associated with a trend toward fewer days hospitalized for HF (p~= 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: BAT is safe and improves functional status, quality of life, exercise capacity, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and possibly the burden of heart failure hospitalizations in patients with GDMT-treated NYHA functional class III HF.

  abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with excessive sympathetic and impaired parasympathetic activity. The Barostim Neo™ device is used for electronical baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) to counteract autonomic nervous system dysbalance. Randomized trials have shown that BAT improves walking distance and reduces N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels at least in patients with only moderate elevation at baseline. Its impact on the risk of heart failure hospitalization (HFH) and death is not yet established, and experience in clinical routine is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on patient characteristics and clinical outcome in a retrospective, non-randomized single-centre registry of BAT in HFrEF. Patients in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes III and IV with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$<$}35\% despite guideline-directed medical therapy were eligible. Symptom burden, echocardiography, and laboratory testing were assessed at baseline and after 12~months. Clinical events of HFH and death were recorded at routine clinical follow-up. Data are shown as number (\%) or median (inter-quartile range). Between 2014 and 2020, 30 patients were treated with BAT. Median age was 67 (63-77) years, and 27 patients (90\%) were male. Most patients (83\%) had previous HFH. Device implantation was successful in all patients. At 12~months, six patients had died and three were alive but did not attend follow-up. NYHA class was III/IV in 26 (87\%)/4 (13\%) patients at baseline, improved in 19 patients, and remained unchanged in 5 patients (P~{$<~$}0.001). LVEF improved from 25.5 (20.0-30.5) \% at baseline to 30.0 (25.0-36.0) \% at 12~months (P~=~0.014). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter remained unchanged. A numerical decrease in NT-proBNP [3165 (880-8085) vs. 1001 (599-3820) pg/mL] was not significant (P~=~0.526). Median follow-up for clinical events was 16 (10-33) months. Mortality at 1 (n~=~6, 20\%) and 3~years (n~=~10, 33\%) was as expected by the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure risk score. Despite BAT, event rate was high in patients with NYHA Class IV, NT-proBNP levels {$>$}1600~pg/mL, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {$<$}30~mL/min at baseline. NYHA class and eGFR were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HFrEF who are selected for BAT are in a stage of worsening or even advanced heart failure. BAT appears to be safe and improves clinical symptoms and-to a modest degree-left ventricular function. The risk of death remains high in advanced disease stages. Patient selection seems to be crucial, and the impact of BAT in earlier disease stages needs to be established.},

  abstract = {Background: Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) exerts in severe heart failure sympathoinhibitory effects, improving clinical variables and reducing hospitalization rate. The current follow-up study was aimed at determining the long-term effects of BAT, assessing whether BAT in heart failure allows to restore physiological levels of sympathetic function. Methods: Seven patients out of the 11 heart failure patients aged 66.5{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}3 years (mean{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}SEM) in New York Heart Association Class III with left ventricular ejection fraction 40\% or less and impaired functional capacity recruited in the study survived at the final follow-up (43.5{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2.1 months). Measurements included muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, microneurography) and spontaneous baroreflex-MSNA sensitivity together with hospitalization rate, echocardiography, Minnesota score, New York Heart Association class and standard clinical data. Measurements were collected before and at 6, 21 and 43 months following BAT. Data were compared with those collected in 17 age-matched healthy controls. All assessments were made with the heart failure patient on optimal active therapy. Results: In the seven patients, BAT maintained its beneficial effects over 43.5{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2.1 months of follow-up. MSNA values underwent a progressive significant reduction from baseline to 21 and 43 months follow-up following BAT (from 46.2{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2.4 to 31.3{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}3.0 e 26.6{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2.0{$\mkern1mu$}bursts/min, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05 at least), becoming almost superimposable to the ones seen in healthy controls (25.5{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}0.8{$\mkern1mu$}bursts/min). Baroreflex-MSNA sensitivity improved, without achieving, however, a full normalization. Blood pressure and heart rate did not change. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 32.3{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2 to 36.7{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}3\% (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). Hospitalization rate decreased substantially when measured as days/year/patients it decreased from 10.3{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}2.5 preimplant to 1.01{$\mkern1mu$}±{$\mkern1mu$}1.4 at the 43.5th month follow-up (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.02). No side effects were reported in the long-term period. Conclusion: The current study provides evidence that BAT in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction allows not only to improve hemodynamic and clinical profile but also to exert profound sympathoinhibitory effects, allowing an almost complete restoration of physiological levels of the sympathetic neural function.},
