  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extravascular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has a single lead implanted substernally to enable pause-prevention pacing, antitachycardia pacing, and defibrillation energy similar to that of transvenous ICDs. The safety and efficacy of extravascular ICDs are not yet known. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-group, nonrandomized, premarket global clinical study involving patients with a class I or IIa indication for an ICD, all of whom received an extravascular ICD system. The primary efficacy end point was successful defibrillation at implantation. The efficacy objective would be met if the lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% confidence interval for the percentage of patients with successful defibrillation was greater than 88\%. The primary safety end point was freedom from major system- or procedure-related complications at 6 months. The safety objective would be met if the lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% confidence interval for the percentage of patients free from such complications was greater than 79\%. RESULTS: A total of 356 patients were enrolled, 316 of whom had an implantation attempt. Among the 302 patients in whom ventricular arrhythmia could be induced and who completed the defibrillation testing protocol, the percentage of patients with successful defibrillation was 98.7\% (lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% confidence interval [CI], 96.6\%; P{$<$}0.001 for the comparison with the performance goal of 88\%); 299 of 316 patients (94.6\%) were discharged with a working ICD system. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the percentage of patients free from major system- or procedure-related complications at 6 months was 92.6\% (lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% CI, 89.0\%; P{$<$}0.001 for the comparison with the performance goal of 79\%). No major intraprocedural complications were reported. At 6 months, 25 major complications were observed, in 23 of 316 patients (7.3\%). The success rate of antitachycardia pacing, as assessed with generalized estimating equations, was 50.8\% (95\% CI, 23.3 to 77.8). A total of 29 patients received 118 inappropriate shocks for 81 arrhythmic episodes. Eight systems were explanted without extravascular ICD replacement over the 10.6-month mean follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective global study, we found that extravascular ICDs were implanted safely and were able to detect and terminate induced ventricular arrhythmias at the time of implantation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substernal lead placement of the extravascular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (EV ICD) permits both defibrillation at thresholds similar to those seen with transvenous ICDs and effective antitachycardia pacing (ATP), while avoiding the vasculature and associated complications. The global Pivotal study has shown the EV ICD system to be safe and effective through 6 months, but long-term experience has yet to be published. We aim to report the performance and safety of the EV ICD system throughout the study. METHODS: The EV ICD Pivotal study was a prospective, global, single-arm, pre-market clinical study. Individuals with a class I or IIa indication for a single-chamber ICD per guidelines were enrolled. Freedom from major system- or procedure-related complications, as well as appropriate and inappropriate therapy rates, were assessed through 3 years using the Kaplan-Meier method. Anti-tachycardia pacing success was calculated using simple proportions. RESULTS: An implant was attempted in 316 patients [25.3\% female, 53.8±13.1 years old, 81.6\% primary prevention, LVEF 38.9\%±15.4\%]. Of 299 patients with a successful implant, 24 experienced 82 spontaneous arrhythmic episodes that were appropriately treated with either ATP only (38, 46.3\%), shock only (34, 41.5\%), or both (10, 12.2\%) for a Kaplan-Meier-estimated rate of first any appropriate therapy of 9.2\% at 3 years. Antitachycardia pacing was successful in 77.1\% (37/48) of episodes, and ATP usage significantly increased from discharge to last follow-up visit (P{$<$}0.0001). Shock therapy was successful in 100\% (27/27) of discrete, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. The inappropriate shock rates at 1 and 3 years were 9.8\% and 17.5\%, respectively, with P-wave oversensing the predominant cause. No major intraprocedural complications were reported and the estimated freedom from system- or procedure-related major complications was 91.9\% at 1 year and 89.0\% at 3 years. The most common major complications were lead dislodgement (10 events; n=9 patients, 2.8\%), postoperative wound or device pocket infection (n=8, 2.5\%), and device inappropriate shock delivery (n=4, 1.3\%). Twenty-four system revisions were performed as a result of major complications related to the EV ICD system or procedure. CONCLUSIONS: From implant to study completion, the EV ICD Pivotal study demonstrated that a single integrated system with an extravascular lead placed in the substernal space maintains high ATP success, effective defibrillation, and a consistent safety profile.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemaker (LP) offers an innovative approach for treating bradyarrhythmia, thus avoiding pacemaker pocket and lead-related complications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved the Aveir™ leadless pacing system (screw-in type LP). METHODS: We queried the FDA MAUDE database to study the safety profile and assess the types of complications with this relatively novel device technology. A MAUDE database search was conducted on January 20, 2023, for reports received post-FDA approval to capture all adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 98 medical device report were reported for Aveir™ LP. After excluding duplicate, programmer-related, or introducer-sheath-related entries (n\,=\,34), 64 entries were included. The most commonly encountered problem was high threshold/noncapture (28.1\%, 18 events), followed by stretched helix (17.2\%, 11 events) and device dislodgement (15.6\%, ten events-5 intraprocedural, while 5 in the postoperative Day 1). Other reported events included high impedance (14.1\%, nine events), sensing issues (12.5\%, eight events), bent/broken helix (7.8\%, five events), premature separation (4.7\%, three events), interrogation problem (3.1\%, two events), low impedance (3.1\%, two events), premature battery depletion (1.6\%, one event) and inadvertent MRI mode switch (1.6\%, one event) and miscellaneous (15.6\%, n\,=\,10). There were eight serious patient injury events-pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis (7.8\%, five events) due to cardiac perforation that resulted in two deaths (3.1\%) followed by sustained ventricular arrhythmias (4.6\%, n\,=\,3). CONCLUSION: In our study assessing the real-world safety profile of the Aveir™ LP, serious adverse events have been reported-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, device explantation/reimplantation, and death.},

  abstract = {Complications after cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) treatment, including permanent pacemakers (PMs), cardiac resynchronization therapy devices with defibrillators (CRT-Ds) or without (CRT-Ps), and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), are associated with increased patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and possibly increased mortality.Population-based cohort study in all Danish patients who underwent a CIED procedure from May 2010 to April 2011. Data on complications were gathered on review of all patient charts while baseline data were obtained from the Danish Pacemaker and ICD Register. Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with 95\% confidence intervals were estimated using binary regression. The study population consisted of 5918 consecutive patients. A total of 562 patients (9.5\%) experienced at least one complication. The risk of any complication was higher if the patient was a female (aRR 1.3; 1.1–1.6), underweight (aRR 1.5; 1.1–2.3), implanted in a centre with an annual volume \&lt;750 procedures (0–249 procedures: aRR 1.6; 1.1–2.2, 250–499: aRR 2.0; 1.6–2.7, 500–749: aRR 1.5; 1.2–1.8), received a dual-chamber ICD (aRR 2.0; 1.4–2.7) or CRT-D (aRR 2.6; 1.9–3.4), underwent system upgrade or lead revision (aRR 1.3; 1.0–1.7), had an operator with an annual volume \&lt;50 procedures (aRR 1.9; 1.4–2.6), or underwent an emergency, out-of-hours procedure (aRR 1.5; 1.0–2.3).CIED complications are more frequent than generally acknowledged. Both patient- and procedure-related predictors may identify patients with a particularly high risk of complications. This information should be taken into account both in individual patient treatment and in the planning of future organization of CIED treatment.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe transvenous implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) lead is the most common source of complications in a traditional ICD system. This investigation aims to determine the incidence, predictors, and costs associated with these complications using a large insurance database.Methods and ResultsData from the OptumLabs™ Data Warehouse, which include diagnosis, physician and procedure codes, and claims from patient hospitalizations, were analyzed. Patients with a de novo ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implanted from January 1, 2003, through June 30, 2015, were included; those who did not have continuous coverage beginning 1~year before implantation were excluded, resulting in 40~837 patients followed up over an average of 2.3±2.1~years. Patients were followed up until they had the procedure or their last active date in the database. Of 20~580 device procedures, 2165 (5.3\%) and 771 (1.9\%) had mechanical and infectious complications, respectively. The 5‐year rate of freedom from mechanical complication was 92.0\% and 89.3\% for ICDs and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, respectively. Infectious complications were more likely in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease, and the risk increased with subsequent device procedures. Younger age, female sex, lack of comorbidities, and implantations between 2003 and 2008 were associated with more mechanical complications.ConclusionsIncidence of mechanical and infectious complications of transvenous ICD leads over long‐term follow‐up is much higher in the real world than in clinical studies. In our study cohort, 1 of 4 transvenous ICD leads had mechanical complications when followed up to 10~years. The high rate of reintervention leads to additional complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemakers represent a paradigm-changing advancement. However, they required innovative and novel device design, including the use of nitinol tines for fixation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the potential for fracture in the novel tine-based fixation mechanism. METHODS: A retrospective approach was used to search the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database for events related to Micra pacemaker tine fracture and damage. Review of each report was performed to ascertain frequency of tine fracture and damage. RESULTS: Of 4241 MAUDE reports (2104 Micra VR, 2167 Micra AV), 230 included the terms "fracture" or "tine," which yielded 7 tine fractures and 19 reports of tine damage. Overall, 2 (29\%) of 7 tine fractures were noted during implantation, whereas 2 (29\%) of 7 were discovered ≥1 week after implantation; 5 (71\%) of 7 tine fracture reports described no associated patient signs or symptoms, and 4 (57\%) of 7 described no change in pacing parameters. Tine damage occurred during implantation in 16 (84\%) of 19, compared with 2 (11\%) of 19 noted ≥1 week after implantation; 15 (79\%) of 19 tine damage cases reported no associated signs or symptoms, and 7 (37\%) of 19 described no changes in pacing parameters. Among all cases, there was 1 case of device embolization. CONCLUSION: The novel tine-based fixation mechanism appears susceptible to a novel failure mechanism-tine fracture and/or damage. Our analysis suggests these events may not always be associated with adverse signs or symptoms. Diligent attention at implantation, and future bench or clinical studies are needed to understand the rate, clinical impact, and mechanism of such failures, and role of surveillance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The extravascular (EV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) includes features to address sensing and arrhythmia detection challenges presented by its substernal lead location. OBJECTIVES In this study, the authors sought to evaluate sensing and detection performance in 299 patients discharged with an EV-ICD in the global pivotal study. METHODS We reviewed and adjudicated all induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes and spontaneous devicestored episodes that satisfied rate and duration criteria in a programmed ventricular tachycardia (VT)/VF therapy zone. RESULTS At implantation, all EV-ICDs detected induced VF at the programmed sensitivity; 95.9\% detected VF with a 3 safety margin. In follow-up, EV-ICDs detected all 59 VT/VF episodes that sustained until therapy. Of 1,034 non-VT/VF episodes, oversensing caused 87.9\% and supraventricular tachycardia caused 12.1\%. Therapy was withheld in 80.9\%, aborted in 10.6\%, and delivered in 8.5\%. The most common causes of oversensing were myopotentials (61.2\%) and Pwave oversensing (PWOS) (19.9\%). Inappropriate shocks occurred in only 3.2\% of myopotential episodes, but in 21.8\% of PWOS episodes. Myopotential oversensing was more common with Ring-Can sensing (P {$<$} 0.0001) and correlated with low R-wave amplitude (P {$<$} 0.0001). PWOS occurred almost exclusively with Ring1-Ring2 sensing (P ¼ 0.0001) and began with transient decrease in R-wave or increase in P-wave amplitude (P {$<$} 0.0001). In software emulation, a new PWOS discriminator significantly reduced total inappropriate detections. CONCLUSIONS In a global population, EV-ICD detected induced and spontaneous VT/VF accurately. Although discriminators withheld detection from most non-VT/VF episodes, inappropriate shocks were common. The most common cause was PWOS, which may be reduced by optimizing sensing at implantation and incorporation of the PWOS discriminator, which is now in the current device.
